# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection Using CNNs  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify chest X-ray images as **normal or pneumonia**. Achieved **94% accuracy** using deep learning.  

## 🗂️ Dataset  
- Source: **[Chest X-ray Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)**  
- Data Size: **5,800+ labeled images** (Normal/Pneumonia)  

## 🏗️ Methods & Models  
- **Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, augmentation  
- **Model Used**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib, os

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- CNN outperformed traditional ML models.  
- Model achieved **94% accuracy** with minimal overfitting.
