# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection Using CNNs  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify chest X-ray images as **normal or pneumonia**. Achieved **94% accuracy** using deep learning.  

## 🗂️ Dataset  
- Source: **[Chest X-ray Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)**  
- Data Size: **5,800+ labeled images** (Normal/Pneumonia)  

## 🏗️ Methods & Models  
- **Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, augmentation  
- **Model Used**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib, os

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- CNN outperformed traditional ML models.  
- Model achieved **94% accuracy** with minimal overfitting.

## 📝 Note on ChatGPT Assistance
During the development and debugging phases of this project, I referenced valuable conversations with ChatGPT that helped me resolve coding issues and improve the overall solution. Unfortunately, these conversations are no longer accessible due to platform limitations, so the specific details cannot be provided here. However, the guidance and debugging steps from those interactions were integral to the project.
